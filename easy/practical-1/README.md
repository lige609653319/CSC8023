## practical-1.1

In the file called `HelloWorld.java`, fill in the main method to print out to console
your name, 'CSC8011 Introduction to Software Engineering', and 'Hello World'.

Expected Output:

```
(your name)
CSC8011 Introduction to Software Engineering
Hello World
```

*Hint: Use `System.out.println("text");` to print a line of output*

To compile and run your code, refer to the instructions on IDE and compilation in the lecture notes. Ask a demonstrator or the module leader
if you are having any difficulty with this.

## practical-1.2

In the method called `addition` print out to console the result of 100 + 50

Expected Result:

```
150
```

### practical-1.2.1

Extension: Remove the values 100 and 50. Create two variables `x` and `y` and
assign 100 and 50 to those variables. Create a third variable `z` and assign the
sum of `x` and `y`. Print to console the value of `z`

### practical-1.2.2

Extension: In the main method, print out the results of the following operations

- -22 + 3 * 2
- (9/2) % 9
- 2,147,483,646 + -15 / 2
- (-2,147,483,646 + -1000/ 2) * 10

Observe the product of the above operations in Java and figure out why you are
receiving those results. 

Expected Output:

```
-16
4
2147483639
-4980
```

## practical-1.3

In the main method, print the sum for the addition, multiply, subtract, divide
and remainder of two numbers `x` and `y` where:

```
int x = 250;
int y = 72;
```

Expected Output:

```
322
18000
178
3
34
```

## practical-1.4

In the method `fancyPrint` complete the method to display the following pattern


```
   J    a   v     v  a                                                                                        
   J   a a   v   v  a a                                                                                       
J  J  aaaaa   V V  aaaaa                                                                                      
 JJ  a     a   V  a     a 
```

*Hint: Nothing too fancy is expected here. System.out.println is enough*
